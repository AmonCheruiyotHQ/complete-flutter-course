# Complete Flutter Course

This course will take you from not knowing Flutter to having the skills to secure a Flutter job. It will take you from the basics of what a widget is, all the way through topics like State Management and eventually deploying your appplications.

We will do this through simplified demo projects to help understand each topic and at the end put it all together into a simplified Twitter Clone application.
